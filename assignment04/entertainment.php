	<!-- <h2>The Evolution of Visual Entertainment</h2>

	<p>
		Theatre, Cinema and Television are forms of visual entertainment were the audience watches a show or a performance. They are different medias through which a story can be narrated and represented. Each form of entertainment makes use of technology to enhance the visual representations. Cinema and Television make the most use of technology such as CGI and Special Effect. However, Theatre too can incorporate modern technologies such as projectors and digital screens to astonish and further immerse the audience in the narration.

	<h2>Theatre</h2>

	<h3>History</h3>

	<p>
		The origins of theatre in ancient Greece, according to Aristotle, the first theoretician of theatre, are to be found in the festivals that honoured Dionysus. The performances were given in semi-circular auditoria cut into hillsides, capable of seating 10,000–20,000 people. The stage consisted of a dancing floor (orchestra), dressing room and scene-building area (skene). Since the words were the most important part, good acoustics and clear delivery were paramount. The actors were only always men and wore masks appropriate to the characters they represented, and each might play several parts.

		Twentieth-century theatre describes a period of great change within the theatrical culture of the 20th century, mainly in Europe and North America. There was a widespread challenge to long-established rules surrounding theatrical representation; resulting in the development of many new forms of theatre, including modernism, Expressionism, Impressionism, political theatre and other forms of Experimental theatre, as well as the continuing development of already established theatrical forms like naturalism and realism.

	<h3>Impacts</h3>
	<p>
		Theater can be used as an instrument for change: Nowadays, social media and video are probably a more effective tool to effect change in society, but there is no media that can cause a bigger impact than theater. Watching a live performance is much more likely to compel you to act for change. The work of theorists like Bertolt Brecht and Augusto Boal is pretty much completely based on this idea, and companies like The Red Room in the UK and many others I´m sure are constantly trying to use theater for this purpose. I don´t remember how the quote went, but I once heard about somebody comparing theater to a hammer that could be used to shape society.

	<h2>Cinema</h2>
	
	<h3>History</h3>

	<p>
		The commercial public screening of ten of Lumière brothers' short films in Paris on 28 December 1895 can be regarded as the breakthrough of projected cinematographic motion pictures. There had been earlier cinematographic results and screenings but these lacked either the quality or the momentum that propelled the cinématographe Lumière into a worldwide success. Soon film production companies were established all over the world. The first decade of motion picture saw film moving from a novelty to an established mass entertainment industry. The earliest films were in black and white, under a minute long and without recorded sound.

		The decade of the 2000s in film involved many significant developments in the film industries around the world, especially in the technology used. Building on developments in the 1990s, computers were used to create effects that would have previously been more expensive, from the subtle erasing of surrounding islands in Cast Away (leaving Tom Hanks' character stranded with no other land in sight) to the vast battle scenes such as those in Gladiator, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Matrix Reloaded, and 300. Also gaining popularity was the use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) to produce films. These types of films were originally seen in the 1990s with the likes of Toy Story, and Antz.

	<h3>Impacts</h3>

	<p>
		Cinema films have the power to influence the thinking of the people. They have changed the society and social trends. They have introduced new fashions in society. They may be described as pace-setters. They can create a direct impact on our social life. Films can go a long way towards arousing national consciousness and also in utilizing the energies of the youth in social reconstruction and nation-building by a skillful adaption of good moral, social and educative themes, and by introduction of popular sentiments, films can, to a great extent, formulate and guide public opinion.Because of their audio visual appeal cinema films are the most powerful means of publicity and advertisement. Small publicity pictures or skits when shown on the screen easily catch the imagination of spectators. The cinema has so far remained unchanged as the most popular audio-visual mass medium, but now with the arrival of television and its impressive pace of advancement, the cinema can no longer afford the luxury of complacence. It has, therefore, to improve its performance and to maintain a high standard.

	<h2>Television</h2>

	<h3>History</h3>

	<p>
		Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but it would still be several years before the new technology would be marketed to consumers. After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions. During the 1950s, television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion. In the mid-1960s, color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries.

	<h3>More Information</h3>

	<p>
		Digital television (DTV) is the transmission of audio and video by digitally processed and multiplexed signals, in contrast to the totally analog and channel separated signals used by analog television. Due to data compression digital TV can support more than one program in the same channel bandwidth. It is an innovative service that represents the first significant evolution in television technology since color television in the 1950s. Digital TV's roots have been tied very closely to the availability of inexpensive, high performance computers. It was not until the 1990s that digital TV became feasible.
	</p>

	<h3>Impacts</h3>

	<p>
		Between the 1940s and 2000s, commercial television had a profound and wide-ranging impact on American society and culture. It influenced the way that people think about such important social issues as race, gender, and class. It played an important role in the political process, particularly in shaping national election campaigns. TV programs and commercials have also been mentioned as major factors contributing to increased American materialism (a view that places more value on acquiring material possessions than on developing in other ways). Finally, television helped to spread American culture around the world.
