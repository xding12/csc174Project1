## Typography
I picked these typefaces, verdana and Times New Roman, because verdana for h1 shows clear and empathetic, which echos the domain of my webpage: the evolution of visual entertainment; Times New Roman for h2 and h3 is a transitional typefaces, which also demonstrates the evolution of visual entertainment.

## Readability
I added padding, margin and border to separate each part, which increases readability of the section. I added line height as well to increase readability.
