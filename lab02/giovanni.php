            <p>I was born in Sicily in the city of Messina but I moved to Milan when I was 3 years old. After studying Information
                Technology and Science at high school, I decided I wanted to attend University abroad. Originally I intended to
                study in the US but I then decided to apply to universities in the UK, because studying in America was extremely
                expensive. At 19 I therefore moved to England to study Computer Science at the University of York.
                I studied 2 years at York and although the campus and the courses were great I still had the dream to study in the
                US!
                So I applied to the exchange program for North America and I managed to be selected for the University of
                Rochester.

            <h2>Extra Curriculars</h2>
            <p>I am currently spending my year abroad at Rochester and I have to say that so far it has been one of the greatest
                experiences of my life. Since the moment I arrived here I felt like it was the right place for me, from the people
                I met to the very stimulating environment that this campus offers.
                Besides focusing on my academics I also decided to get involved in extra curricular activities, so I ended up
                creating a fitness club called Meliora Fitness to promote the benefits of physical exercise and provide free
                bodyweight training classes to students.
                Additionally I also took part in Greek Life by joining Beta Theta Pi, a fraternity in which I was able to find many
                smart and like minded people.

            <h2>Courses</h2>
            <p>In my Fall semester I took 5 classes: CAS 170 which is a class for international students regarding the American
                culture, CSC 240 Data Mining which was quite interesting but I realized that it is not an area I want to expand on,
                CSC 214 iOS Development where I learned and experimented with Swift, CSC 170 Intro to Web Development which allowed
                to learn web development in a formal way and also made me practice my design skills, finally CSC 210 which focused
                more on Back End technologies and was a great complement to CSC 170.

            <h2>Future Plans</h2>
            <p>I am enjoying my experience at Rochester so much that I am considering transferring and finishing my degree there.
                Although the transfer process is quite complex for my situation, since I am a third year student, I believe it will
                be worth graduating in the US. Especially considering my goal to eventually move to California and create a
                business there.
