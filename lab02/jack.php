			<p>	I am a Mechanical Engineering major at the University of Rochester, and I am also minoring in Computer Science. I am very interested in how the world works, and I find both theoretical research and its application interesting. However, I decided to major in Mechanical Engineering because the idea of building something that could impact others interests me, which is why I also decided to minor in computer science. So far at UofR, I have taken the following courses: CSC 170, CSC 171, CSC 172, CSC 214, and CSC 240. Additionally, I have been a CHM 132 Lab Teacher Assistant, and I am currently a CSC 240/440 TA.

			<h2>Early Life</h2>
			<p>I am originally from Louisiana, but I moved around the state a lot. At the beginning of sophomore year of high school, I left my home to attend a public, boarding school in rural, northern Louisiana. My high school was very different from others in that its focus was academics and maintaining a positive public image (it was basically UofR). Therefore, while I volunteered a lot and did various other community service events, I was learning a lot about what I wanted to do. It was there, where I learned about careers in the sciences and began to think about what I wanted to do with my life. Three years later, I was faced with the decision to stay or leave Louisiana. In the end, I decided that there weren’t many opportunities for me in Louisiana, and I eventually learned of the UofR. This campus offered me a different perspective on cultural, social, and political issues, which trully interested me. And here I am.

			<h2>Work Life</h2>
			<p>During my time at the University of Rochester, I have worked at a couple of different positions. During the summers, I worked at Lullaby Sound Design in Louisiana, which is a company that makes hand-made, tube amplifiers for guitars and violins. There I learned how to make these amplifiers and the different devices that were sold. During the academic years, I have also worked on campus as a CHM 132 Lab TA, which gave me a new perspective on the experiments, and I am currently a CSC 240/440 TA. Additionally, I am in the process of being hired for a student-worker position on campus, which I am excited for. </p>

			<h2>Free Time</h2>
			<p>In my free time, I enjoy going on hikes, visiting parks, museums, and other activities. However, most of the time I spend outside of class and doing homework, I find myself learning things that interest me and participate in organizations on campus. Currently, I am learning how to play the guitar and how to build a self-balancing robot using arduino.
