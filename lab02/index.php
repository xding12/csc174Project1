        <h2>Giovanni Ilacqua</h2>
        <p>I was born in Sicily in the city of Messina but I moved to Milan when I was 3 years old. After studying Information
            Technology and Science at high school, I decided I wanted to attend University abroad. Originally I intended to
            study in the US but I then decided to apply to universities in the UK, because studying in America was extremely
            expensive. At 19 I therefore moved to England to study Computer Science at the University of York.
            I studied 2 years at York and although the campus and the courses were great I still had the dream to study in the
            US!
            So I applied to the exchange program for North America and I managed to be selected for the University of
            Rochester.</p>

        <h2>Genessis Galindo</h2>

        <p>I am a student majoring in Business, with a concentration in Analytics, and minoring in Computer Science and Spanish. Before coming to the University of Rochester, I attended Canyon High School in California where I was involved in various extracurricular such as: Student Government, National Honor Society, English National Honor Society, Spirit Club, Chemistry Club, and a few others. I even founded a chapter of the Science National Honor Society at my school and at the time I believed I wanted to major in Chemistry.</p>

        <h2>Jack Dalton</h2>
        <p> I am a Mechanical Engineering major at the University of Rochester, and I am also minoring in Computer Science. I am very interested in how the world works, and I find both theoretical research and its application interesting. However, I decided to major in Mechanical Engineering because the idea of building something that could impact others interests me, which is why I also decided to minor in computer science. So far at UofR, I have taken the following courses: CSC 170, CSC 171, CSC 172, CSC 214, and CSC 240. Additionally, I have been a CHM 132 Lab Teacher Assistant, and I am currently a CSC 240/440 TA.</p>
